# STA-215-Final-Project

My package contains the amount of plays that songs on the top 100 billboard had at the week of September 7th 2025. It then compares that information to the length of time that the song has spent on the billboard top 100 in weeks. 

# Instructions
To view and properly run the script, open the "andrejc1-final_project.R" file which has the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the Music2 (1).xlsx file and you can view both the Data Table Tabular and the Descriptive Table.

# Data
All points of data in this project were taken from the week of September 7th 2025 Billboard.com/charts/hot-100/. 

# Operationalization
To perationalize the listens, I went onto Spotify and copied the number from there into a Google Sheets file.

I did something similar for finding out how long a song has been on the billboard top 100. I would go to the Artists Billboard page and look for the song, seeing it's duration on the top 100 and writing it down onto the document.

THe concept of chart information shows the highest that a song reached during it's time on the Billboard's top 100. It also shows how long it's been there.

The concept of the song's details shows the basic facts about each song, mostly things that people would want to know if they were to do exactly what this project does.
